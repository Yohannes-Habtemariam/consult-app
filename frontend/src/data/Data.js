      "Before you invest, you need to do a thorough research on fundamental and technical analyses. Fundamental analysis is the cornerstone of investing in financial market. In fact, some experts say that you are not really investing if you are not performing fundamental analysis. Although the biggest part of fundamental analysis involves delving into the financial statements, it should focus mainly on three essential aspects, such as macroeconomic analysis, industry analysis, and company analysis. Fundamental analysis combines economic, industry, and company analyses to study everything that affect the security’s value to drive a stock’s fair value which is called intrinsic value.",

Specially, technical analysis is used as a supplement to fundamental analysis rather than as a substitute to it. Technical analysis focuses at the price of a stock derived as a result of supply and demand interaction in the market. In a technical analysis, investors look at two main aspects in the market, such as price and volume. Hence, technical analysis is a method of evaluating securities by analyzing the statistics generated by market activity, such as past prices and volume, but it does not attempt to measure the intrinsic value of a security.",
